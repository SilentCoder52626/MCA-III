## **Introduction**

Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical technique used to determine the best possible outcome in a given mathematical model. Its primary objective is to maximize or minimize a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear constraints. LP is widely used in areas such as manufacturing, transportation, finance, and service operations to optimize resource utilization.

## **Formulation of a Linear Programming Problem**

Formulating a linear programming problem involves the following steps:

1. **Define decision variables:**
   These represent the unknowns that we need to determine.

2. **Construct the objective function:**
   A linear function that needs to be maximized or minimized (e.g., profit, cost, time).

3. **Set up the constraints:**
   These are linear inequalities or equations representing the restrictions on available resources.

4. **Include non-negativity constraints:**
   Decision variables are usually non-negative (i.e., ≥ 0).

### **Example:**

A company produces two products, A and B.

* Profit per unit: A = \$3, B = \$5
* Resource constraints:

  * Machine 1: 2A + 3B ≤ 100 hours
  * Machine 2: 4A + B ≤ 80 hours

**Formulation:**
Let x = units of A, y = units of B

**Objective function:**
Maximize Z = 3x + 5y

**Subject to constraints:**

* 2x + 3y ≤ 100
* 4x + y ≤ 80
* x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0

## **Benefits of Linear Programming**

1. **Optimal Resource Utilization:** Helps in making the best use of available resources.
2. **Improved Decision Making:** Provides a clear, structured method for decision-making.
3. **Cost Reduction and Profit Maximization:** Useful in reducing costs or increasing profits.
4. **Flexibility:** Can be applied to various fields (logistics, finance, agriculture, etc.).
5. **Insightful Sensitivity Analysis:** Helps assess how changes in parameters affect the outcome.

## **Limitations of Linear Programming**

1. **Linearity Assumption:** Real-world problems may not always be linear.
2. **Certainty Assumption:** Assumes all coefficients are known with certainty, which may not be realistic.
3. **Integer Solutions:** LP provides continuous solutions, not always suitable when variables must be integers.
4. **Single Objective Function:** LP handles only one objective at a time.
5. **Scalability Issues:** Very large problems may become computationally intensive.

## **Graphical Solutions to Linear Programming Problem**

The graphical method is used for solving LP problems with **two decision variables**.

### **Steps:**

1. **Plot the constraints** on a graph.
2. **Identify the feasible region** that satisfies all constraints.
3. **Plot the objective function line** and move it parallelly to find the optimal point.
4. **Find the point(s) of intersection** (corner points) within the feasible region.
5. **Evaluate the objective function** at each corner point to find the optimal solution.

### **Example (continued from above):**

Plot the lines:

* 2x + 3y = 100
* 4x + y = 80

Shade the region where all inequalities are satisfied, then evaluate Z = 3x + 5y at each vertex of the feasible region.
